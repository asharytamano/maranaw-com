# VISION — MARANAW DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM

We envision a living, growing digital world where **Maranao heritage, faith, language, wisdom, and identity** are not only preserved, but made accessible, respected, and alive for generations to come.

The Maranaw Digital Ecosystem will stand as:

- A **global digital archive** of Maranao culture, history, and literature
- A **faith-based knowledge hub** grounded in authentic Tafsir and Qur’anic understanding
- A **learning platform** for students, teachers, scholars, and communities
- A **bridge between tradition and technology**
- A **model of digital transformation** for Muslim Filipino governance and community development

It is a vision where:

- A child in Tugaya, Marawi, Jeddah, London, or New York can learn what it means to be Maranao
- A student can study Tafsir in the Maranao language using a mobile phone
- A researcher can access Darangen, proverbs, and history in one place
- A community can reconnect with faith, language, and roots through technology
- The world can finally see the richness and dignity of the Maranao people

This is not simply a technical project.

It is a **digital home for a people.**  
It is a **living torogan in cyberspace.**

Built not for fame, not for wealth —  
but for **identity, preservation, and legacy.**

> *A legacy not just for today, but for the next 100 years and beyond.*
